                              <p>Credit goes to <i>Robert Frost</i>. Basically love means mutual sharing of  emotion between two persons or more.Its like to hear asusal what others say.But just listen that love is not sharing of only happiness,but also it also shares someother emotions which may feel yourself incomplete.True love is the action of expression on something when you are admired it on its nature of what it is!.. </p>

                         <p>While reading the above lines, it may get mixed you.Love is also like that...while experiencing it we have no clearity. We must take in the fact that love make things better than possible it can. Once my friend asked me that how was the feeling of love. I was really stunned while hearing it.Then I refer many blogs and writings of some famous author and finally i understood that <em>love is confusible</em>...Basically there are different types of love feelings in my view.</p>

                    <h4>Is Love an Emotion?</h4>
                    <p>Psychologists, sociologists, and researchers disagree somewhat on the characterization of love. Many say it's not an emotion in the way we typically understand them, but an essential physiological drive. Conversely, the American Psychological Association defines it as "a complex emotion."</p>

                              <p>When it comes to love, some people would say it is one of the most important human emotions. Yet despite being one of the most studied behaviors, it is still the least understood. For example, researchers debate whether love is a biological or cultural phenomenon. </p>
                              <p>Love is most likely influenced by both biology and culture. Although hormones and biology are important, the way we express and experience love is also influenced by our personal conceptions of love.</p>
